            As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues with global cases nearing 2.5 million, clinicians
            have raised questions about the accuracy of available COVID-19 tests. After in-house
            testing of different available tests, one physician found that Abbott’s assay using its
            ID NOW device, which can provide results in 5–13 minutes, has a false-negative rate that
            nears 15 percent. The full results, first reported by NPR, have not been published or
            peer-reviewed.

            Gary Procop is the chairman of the commission of science, technology and policy for the
            American Society for Clinical Pathology, and is currently heading up COVID-19 testing at
            Cleveland Clinic. He and his team took 239 patient samples known to be positive for the
            virus and re-tested them using five products available through the US Food and Drug
            Administration’s (FDA) emergency use authorization. The test that turned out to be the
            least accurate is the one known for its speed.

            The ID NOW machine was granted emergency use approval during the pandemic on March 27
            and generated buzz after President Donald Trump unveiled it during a press conference.
            In Procop’s analysis, Abbott’s test had a false-negative rate of 14.8 percent.{' '}

            The DiaSorin Simplexa test had a false-negative rate of around 11 percent. Tests
            developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Cepheid, and Roche had
            false-negative rates of 0, 1.8, and 3.5 percent, respectively. In the wake of the
            study’s results, Procop’s facility is no longer using the Abbott test, and he is not the
            only administrator to make that decision.

          <p>
            Alan Wells, a pathologist at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, tells STAT
            that his facility is not using the test anymore because the viral load of the patient
            might play a role with testing accuracy, more readily identifying those with higher
            levels. “However, with lower loads of virus, a large fraction of these patients were not
            detected as positive,” he says. STAT also reports that Emily Miller, an OB-GYN at
            Northwestern University, referred to the test as “clinically not useful” to identify the
            virus in expectant mothers. According to NPR, Abbott disagrees with Procop’s findings,
            stating that any errors might come from the use of viral transport media, which is
            commonplace in testing and helps extend the shelf life of the sample. All of the samples
            in Procop’s study used this media rather than testing directly from the nasal swab.
            Abbott has sent letters to the healthcare facilities that have received some of the
            600,000 tests, advising them to test directly with the swab, which yields the most
            reliable results.
