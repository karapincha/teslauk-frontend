            <li>Detailed step-by-step guides for technical/complex processes.</li>

          <h4>Before creating a guide please:</h4>

          <ol>
            <li>
              Kindly check <a>https://teslaowners.org.uk/guides</a> to see if a similar guide
              already exists or another could be slightly amended to add the content you’re thinking
              of creating. If you wish to make changes to an existing article visit the article and
              at the bottom click on ‘Like or Dislike’ and a box will appear to provide feedback,
              this gets checked by the team periodically and changes will be made ASAP.
            </li>
            <li>
              You may wish to write the content on Google Docs or similar before adding it to{' '}
              <a>https://teslaowners.org.uk/my-account/author</a> as formating isn’t ideal. If you
              plan to write lots of content please get in touch with the web manager who can help by
              swapping your account to an Author.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h4>Things to consider:</h4>

          <ul>
            <li>Try to remove any personal opinions/bias.</li>
            <li>Ensure you suitably reference any 3rd party content.</li>
            <li>
              See where you can cross-link to similar guides to remove duplication of content.
            </li>
            <li>No personal referral links or self-promotion allowed.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>How do I submit content?</h4>

          <ul>
            <li>
              All supporters can submit content within <a>https://teslaowners.org.uk/author</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              If you wish to provide more help (e.g. writing multiple articles or amending existing)
              <a> speak with the Web Manager</a> or who can help further by swapping your account to
              an ‘Author’.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>After submitting your guide:</h4>

          <ul>
            <li>
              The Tesla Owners UK team will check over the content and make any amendments (e.g.
              formatting) and add any required images.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once ready it will be posted on the guides section of the website for all to view.
            </li>
          </ul>
