              Whilst representing 30% of Tesla owners in the UK we deliver a plethora of events
              nationwide; support where Tesla cannot or will not; coordination for fundraising and
              charitable acts; representation to Government & Tesla; education to promote the uptake
              and adoption of electric vehicles, renewable energy & zero carbon living; and
              fostering of good relations between Members, Staff, and other supporters of Tesla, and
              other parties who seek to achieve similar aims and purposes to the Club.
              <br />
              <br />
              To maximise utilisation we take a proactive approach with owners to enable onboarding,
              education and mentorship from before ownership starts to after their first event, then
              the fun really starts with our in-person events (3 per month across the UK); track
              days (12 per year); large scale events (circa 200+ owners per event); road trip
              events; finally numerous discussion groups (circa 32,000 posts with 543,000 comments
              per year) and guides on our website ensure continued support throughout all aspects of
              ownership.
